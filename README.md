# Food-Hunters-web-project

Languages: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, AJAX(for more responsiveness on the browser), jQuerry, PHP
 This project is one I had to do on faculty in the first year at the Elements of Web Design.
  Firstly when you get into the page you are asked to login or to sign up if you don't have a account. The data is stored into a database(MySQL) and it uses PHP for the server side.
  It has a little bit of functionalities with JS and a lot of CSS styling, the data stored in database is encrypted for privacy.
